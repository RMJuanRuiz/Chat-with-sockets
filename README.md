# Chat Rooms

Chat where users can join in different rooms, view connected users and talk with all users in the room. It was developed with Node.js, express and Sockets. Also I use Admin Pro template to frontend.

# Features:
- Users can join in different rooms and send messages to all users in that room.
- All chat rooms are completely independent, users in one room cannot interact with users in another room.

If you want to run it locally, remember run npm install
